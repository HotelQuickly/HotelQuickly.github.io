title: How does it work at HotelQuickly? (Jim)

Working at HotelQuickly to me means doing what you love. 
As you know we're a brand new superstar startup that means a lot of of work need to be done. 
In the early day our IT Team have around 4 hackers. 
With limited resource... work need to be done... challenge! is it? 
Honestly sometime we're tired, but imagine you're doing something you love. Resting? Sleeping? 
Eating? (exclude chocolate time) no need anymore! ;)

As we have many work need to be done. you can rotate your position to do even something new to you. 
I'm start here with BlackBerry development then PHP development then Infrastructure administration then Android development.
It's kind of build something big with real impact from your hands. 

What I'm currently doing right now is design architecture to handle high traffic ~1.000 req/sec in the very first minute 
after launch this campaign. Sound cool? What relaxing time? 

Usually on Friday night we've special event with whole office such as beer pong! (drinker huh?) 
and sometime our CFO lead a team to some mysterious places that you cannot imagine!
