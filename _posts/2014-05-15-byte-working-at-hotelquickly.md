I am working for 5 months at HotelQuickly as a Backend developer. 
We don’t have much Thai people here but I can improve my English communication better. 
Many funny guys are here. The most challenge thing is improving Backend to get better and better stable and performance, 
and adding new things according to business requirements. 
For the Backend, we uses [Nette](http://nette.org/) which is PHP Framework. 
It’s very easy and comfortable to coding and debugging. 

Now, I am working on customer payment which is important part. 
We can connect to many payment gateways such as PayPal. 
You know that it’s very important because it’s about money! 
So, it’s one of my challenges here. Need to test more and more before release it.

Many new things I got here such as tools and technique. 
Except Nette above, other tools that I am using every day is [Asana](http://www.asana.com) 
which is task management on web app. 
We can know what tasks remaining, cooperate with teams more quickly and comfortably. 
And, we use [Github](http://www.github.com) which is very cool online code control system that I never used before. 

I learned how to write code in the best way and practiced more about how to create best object oriented software. 
Moreover, I am impressed to work with wonderful and smart colleague here, 
we share many benefit things together which is awesome feeling.
