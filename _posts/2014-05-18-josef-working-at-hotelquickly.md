title: Why to work in HotelQuickly? (Josef)
author: Josef
---

Before I joined HotelQuickly, I was working as a website developer (PHP+MySQL) for 7 years. One website after another, not much challenging.

After joing HQ, work become to be a challange. Big challange. There is still so much to learn. Before, I have never developed an mobile application in Titanium framework. I have never done administration of server. I have not written a single bash script. I have not developed native iOS application. I have not used unit tests. I barely spoke English.

Now I do. Why? Because startup.

Changing. Moving. Growing. Non-stop. Wanna learn new things? Come to work with us.
