## Planning

Since we want to build the best last-minute hotel booking app, we're testing it with random users.

After a few days of user testing we compiled suggestinos for those of you keen to organize similar sessions.


## Preparation

Install HockeyApp on testing device - it's important to be able to quickly download a new build after each user, so make sure you have it installed.

Buy a tripod for the camera - we tried it once without and it sucked. So much easier with a tripod.

Make sure you've got enough space on the camera. Our average 20-min-long video has about 1.2 GB. Make sure you've got at least 16 GB memory card for 10 users. We went out of memory recently and it was painful to copy it while people were waiting.

Plan at least 30 minutes for one session and add 10 min buffer (at least). We saw people coming late recently - well, we're in Thailand, no surprise ;-)

If possible, bring at least 2 cameras. Focus one on the phone and the other on the user to record his facial expressions after being impressed from the app! :-) Just kidding...

Prepare a test account for faster login and test credit card. We used the magic number 4111 1111 1111 1111.

Don't forget paper and a pen so that you can take notes. Right, Josef? :)


## Testing session

### Before the meeting

Delete the app and install it from HockeyApp. In our case it's important to delete all the user data so that the new tester sees the getting started screen and tutorials.

### Introduction during the meeting

Before you start the testing itself, explain to each user the follorwing:

* **Goal of the session** - check if the users are able to use the app easily and without any hickups can follow the scenarios. 
* **Talking** - ask the user to talk as much as possible to explain his thinking process. If he's quiet for 30 seconds, it will not help us. He needs to talk about his expectations.
* **Timing** - explain that the session will take 20-30 minutes.
* **Video-recording** - mention that we're gonna video-record the session, but will focus the camera on the phone only.
* **Tasks to complete** - mention that there are about 10 tasks they are about to complete one by one. Make sure they understand that if they are not able to finish some of them, it's not their fault, but ours.
* **Mobile on the table** - since we're video-recording the session, it's important the phone is lying on the table. Don't hold it in hands.
* **iOS or Android user** - ask if he/she is Android or iOS user. You'll need to know after you'll see them being struggled with the app navigation.

After all is clear, turn on the video-camera and start with the questions.

### Testing questions

We defined a few key areas that are extremely important and all users should get them done easily. For example:

* passing through registration / login
* getting to hotel gallery
* checking hotel facilities and map directions
* booking a hotel (incl. adding a credit card)
* sharing and credits

### Question 1
Select any hotel you would like to book tomorrow in Singapore

(talk me through the process, what you are thinking, why did you select the hotel etc) 

observe: country selection, tomorrow booking

### Question 2
Book hotel *HQ Palace* hotel for 3 nights

Add prepared credit card and actually book the hotel

### Question 3
How do you get to the hotel you booked from where you are?

GPS navigation working? People realising where they are, where the hotel is and how to get there?

### Question 4
Share this booking with your friends

### Question 5
Tell me the total amount of credits you have now

Do users even know they have credits?

### Question 6
How can you increase the number of your credits?

Do users get the invite your friends to get more credits? Then ask them to do so (invite).

### Question 7
Select the hotel with the best deal for you for today (what criteria are you looking for?)

### Question 8
Send the cheapest hotel to your friend

Filter for the cheapest hotels + sharing function

### Question 9
Does the hotel have free wifi? How is the hotel you selected reviewed? Does it have breakfast included?


## Processing

It's painful to process hours of video recordings, so make sure your notes already cover 90% of the important stuff. Re-play the important / most difficult sessions only.
